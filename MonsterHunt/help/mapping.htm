<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial">If you need any more info, stop by the <A href="http://www.unreal.co.za/shrimp/forum/">ShrimpWorks forums</A>, there you'll find the Monster Hunt forum where you can ask questions.</FONT></P>
<HR width="75%" align="center">
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial"><B><I>Monster Hunt</I></B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial"> - Before you start on a map, open the MonsterHunt.u package in the class-browser so you have access to all the Monster Hunt-specific stuff.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial"> - Maps should be more of a single player style, 
  but make sure there are enough pickups for all the players and that there's 
  enough space for a group of players to move around in.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial"> - Boss monsters should be in large spacious areas, 
  the players must be able to concentrate on defeating the monsters and not have 
  to worry about the surrounding architecture.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial"> - Make an escape route for the players to run 
  through and place a MonsterEnd trigger (found in the classe-browser: Triggers 
  -> Trigger -> MonsterEnd) where the players will run to end the level.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial"> - If you want to add bot support to your map (very highly recommended), you can use the MonsterWaypoint actor (found in the classe-browser: Keypoint 
  -> MonsterWaypoint). Just put the MonsterWaypoint actors wherever you want a bot waypoint to be, like near a button or a lever, or just along the path through the level. Set it's Position property to tell the bots in which order the waypoints must be visited. Set the first one at 1, the next at 2, then 3, and so on. You can also enter the Event tag of a particular actor so when the bot gets to the waypoint, something can be triggered to happen.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial"> - Be sure to add lots of PlayerStarts at the beginning 
  of the level to make sure the players don't telefrag each other when the round 
  starts - about 12-18 will be enough for a normal size map.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial"> - You can implement simple puzzles for the players 
  to solve along the way, but don't use too many as players will probably get 
  frustrated.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial"> - Feel free to use as many special effects as 
  you like, in this style of game, the players will really take note an think 
  "How'd they do that???" :-) </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial">- Remember that there is no Translocator, so don't 
  make any situations where it's needed to progress.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial"> - The difficulty of the map is important, start 
  with relatively weak monsters and as players progress through the level, use 
  stronger and stronger enemies.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial"> - Make sure your Boss monster is pretty strong, 
  players will be disappointed it only takes a few shots to kill it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial"> - Don't put any monsters near to where the players 
  will start, they'll all be slaughtered as soon as they spawn.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial"> - Environmental hazzards (slime, lava, huge drops, 
  etc.) are great, but make sure the boss monster(s) can't fall in, or it'll spoil 
  the fun of defeating them.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial"> - Don't give the players the best guns at the 
  beginning, or they'll mow through the monsters too easily.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial">- Use the MonsterEvent (under Triggers &gt; SpecialEvent) 
  to display messages for the players, everything has already been pre-configured, 
  just type the message and connect it to a trigger.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial">- Set the boss monster's bIsBoss to True so the player can get extra points for killing him.</FONT></P>
<HR width="75%" align="center">
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial"><B><I>Monster Arena</I></B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial">- The same rules that apply to Monster Hunt maps 
  apply to Monster Arena maps as well, but there are a few more things to keep 
  in mind:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial">- Make sure you create a small protected area somewhere 
  in the map that the players can safely spawn in, you can even seal it off by 
  using a door.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial"> - You should provide the players with some guns 
  in the protected area but don't give them too many and make sure the weapons 
  suit the arena and the monster to be killed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial"> - Place as much health and ammo around the arena 
  as you like.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial"> - Give the players lots of place to move in, and 
  make sure the boss can't get stuck anywhere. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial">- Place a MonsterArenaEnd trigger in the map (found 
  in the classes browser: Triggers -> Trigger -> MonsterEnd -> MonsterArenaEnd) 
  and set an Event for the boss and set the Tag of the MonsterArenaEnd to corrospond 
  with the boss' Event. (<I>IMPORTANT! - Make sure you add the trigger in the 
  centre of the map using the Top View</I>)</FONT></P>
