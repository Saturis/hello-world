<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial">Welcome to Monster Hunt!! Monster Hunt (MH from 
  now on) is a modification for Unreal Tournament (UT from now on) that allows 
  you and your team of hunters to fight your way through hoards of monsters attempting 
  to prevent you from escaping. MH is played in specially designed maps (see "<A href="mapping.htm">Mapping 
  for Monster Hunt</A>") full of monsters that appeared in the original Unreal 
  (and hopefully many new ones in the future), and at the end of each map, you'll 
  be faced with a Boss monster (or a few :-) that must be defeated to continue.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial"> You can also try out Monster Arena, you and your 
  team must enter an arena with the biggest, badest, most powerful monsters you're 
  likely to face anywhere and beat the hell out of them to survive!</FONT></P>
