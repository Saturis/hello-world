<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial">Teamplay has a strong role in successfully completing 
  a hunt, if players don't work as a team to accomplish objectives, they'll no 
  doubt all end up dead pretty soon, those monsters don't fool around! Sharing 
  pickups also becomes important, if one player grabs everything, the rest are 
  left with nothing and will end up dead. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial">Because of the nature of MH, players may be faced 
  with the occasional puzzle to solve but they won't be as in-depth as a single 
  player game might have - the emphasis is on action, not brainstorming.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial">The Translocator has been disabled in MH games, 
  as it could spoil certain scenarios. The Chainsaw replaces the Impact Hammer 
  as the default weapon for all that hack and slash goodness it provides :-)</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial"><B><I>Monster Arena</I></B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial">Much like a traditional DeathMatch, but you're 
  not playing against other players, you and your team are battling it out to 
  the death against giant bloodthirsty monsters.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial"> Players all start in an area protected from the 
  monsters. Here, they have a chance to grab the weapons they'll be needing in 
  the battle to come - there are no other weapons other than those provided at 
  the start, you will however, be able to find ammo in the arena itself. Once 
  the monster(s) are killed, you will automatically be taken to the next arena.</FONT></P>
