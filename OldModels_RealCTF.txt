		http://www.unreality.dk/usaar33
	Converted by Psychic_313; original Unreal skins by the RealCTF team

Mod description
===============

RealCTF was a Capture the Flag mod for Unreal I. As part of his Oldskool Amp'd project, UsAaR33
requested and received permission to use the RealCTF team skins as additional skins.

The original skins only came in blue and red versions. This version adds neutral, green and gold
versions adapted by Simon "Psychic_313" McVittie, providing complete team colours for all skins.

Original authors
================

The RealCTF skins team were:



Unfortunately, I don't know which skins were by which author.

Installation
============

Windows users: unzip and double-click the UMOD.
If you have problems with UMOD files, try these pages:
	http://www.planetunreal.com/umodwizard/umodfaq.htm
	http://www.pseudorandom.co.uk/paradox/unreal/utmodsfaq.htm
There is no non-UMOD version of this mod. This is deliberate. If you can't install it, there
are two possibilities:
2) UMODs are generally broken on your computer. Try the web pages mentioned above to fix UMODs.
3) The UMOD or zip file might be corrupted. Download it again and try again.

Linux and Mac users: unzip with InfoZip or similar, then install the UMOD with UMODPack
(you'll need Perl to run UMODPack) or some other UMOD reader (is there an official Mac one?)

Server installation
===================

The UMOD does not add serverpackages, so do this manually:
Under the "[Engine.GameEngine]" heading, you should have a list of "ServerPackages="
lines including the following lines. If any are not present, add them at the end:

ServerPackages=Female1SkinsUT_RealCTF
ServerPackages=Female2SkinsUT_RealCTF
ServerPackages=Male1SkinsUT_RealCTF
ServerPackages=Male2SkinsUT_RealCTF
ServerPackages=Male3SkinsUT_RealCTF
ServerPackages=SkTrooperSkinsUT_RealCTF

Also check the OldModels readme for its ServerPackages - these are needed too.

FAQ
===

-- I installed Oldskool Models, but they won't work in multiplayer! Why?

To let players use any mod online (this includes models, skins, voices and so on), the
server admin must have added them to their server's ServerPackages list.

Unfortunately, anyone joining a game will be forced to download any of the ServerPackages
they don't have, even if nobody is currently using that mod! This is frustrating for the
players, and takes up bandwidth from the server (leaving less for the actual gameplay),
so admins are reluctant to do this except for certain very popular models (Bonus Pack 1 is
installed on about 50% of servers, in my experience, and BP 4 on about 10%).

UsAaR33 is currently working on a mod to make model and skin support act a bit more like
Quake-engine games (Q3, Half-Life) where any model or skin you don't have appears as some
default model, so server admins will only need to install this mod and players will be able
to use any skin or model (of course, the less popular your skin, the more likely the other
players are to not have it and see you as a default model like Male Soldier anyway). Look out
for a mod called "Valhalla Avatar".
